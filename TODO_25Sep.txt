New method:
Run PCA on raw continuous data, identify the component containing the trigger artefact. Reject the artefact from continuous data, then proceed to preprocessing (filtering, detrend, etc).

Script has been modified for this (only on M3 local repo).

===

What to do?

Run a few indi subjects. Visually identify components to reject & enter into dlgbox.
Check single-subject GFP - see if 'trigger spike' is gone.


RESULTS:
M03 - not so good. Already being quite non-conservative (picked 6 suspicious comps to remove), but trigger spike is still present in both pre-cue & pre-target baseline around -60ms.


= If this doesn't work =

Opt 1. go back to removing trigger artefact on average ERF (still waiting on an answer regarding the validity of this)

Opt 2. try other links Paul sent me on 20 Sep

Opt 3. stick with the "[best]2" version from b4 PGRF trip
