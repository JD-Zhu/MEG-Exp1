TODO:

[DONE] 1. Test Robert's MEMES3 script (by running source_v1).

Problems:
(1) subjects with 2 bad coils show upside-down sensors (M08, M10) 

(2) meshes with holes -> we'll just remove these MRIs from the database
 

2. Trigger leak

Opt (1):

Go back to projecting out on ave ERF
-   Finish script to remove trigger on ave ERF;
-   Try on a few subjects. Check single-subject GFP - see if 'trigger spike' is gone.

Have checked with Paul: can use 0~650ms for covmatrix, while ERF is computed 0~750ms. For target-locked, prob ok to use 0~500ms as I did.

Q: Exactly how to select covariance windows appropriately?
A: usually beamformer uses the whole trial to compute covmatrix (avg over time).
[Do some reading on this myself / ask on forums]

Opt (2):

remove the -60-45ms section in cue-lock baseline, target-lock baseline, and end of cue-locked. replace using a "line of best fit" joining the 2 edge points.

========================

New method:
Run PCA on raw continuous data, identify the component containing the trigger artefact. Reject the artefact from continuous data, then proceed to preprocessing (filtering, detrend, etc).

Script has been modified for this (only on M3 local repo).

===

What to do?

Run a few indi subjects. Visually identify components to reject & enter into dlgbox.
Check single-subject GFP - see if 'trigger spike' is gone.


RESULTS:
M03 - not so good. Already being quite non-conservative (picked 6 suspicious comps to remove), but trigger spike is still present in both pre-cue & pre-target baseline around -60ms.


= If this doesn't work =

Opt 1. go back to removing trigger artefact on average ERF (still waiting on an answer regarding the validity of this) <= ACTUALLY THIS SHOULD BE VALID! Because the covmatrix is not computed from the baseline period (i.e. it should be irrelevant whether we clean the trigger spike or not); the cue-locked covmatrix may be affected by the spike at the end of the cue window, but we can easily fix this - just compute the covmatrix on [0 0.7].



Opt 2. try other links Paul sent me on 20 Sep

Opt 3. stick with the "[best]2" version from b4 PGRF trip <= main effect of switch (in cue window) is only marginally sig
