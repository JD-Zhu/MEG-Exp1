= Re-running the version before any "TRIGGER artefact removal", removing channels 81-89 =

Aim: hopefully this retains the old effects (because minimum change to the data), but also get rid of trigger spike (because we remove the 9 channels)

In source_v1:
Using HCP database & MEMES1 - the subjects with bad coils have problems in coreg:
M08 - see attached pic
M10
M20

Check again (brain very tilted to the right):
M21 - see attached pic

=
Attempted solution (tried on M08): add the new features from MEMES3 (for handling 2 bad coils) into MEMES1/MEMES2, in order to make 2-bad-coil subjects work with the HCP database:

MEMES1 - copied over the new features (esp for 2 bad coils) from MEMES3
    >> doesn't work, plots are tilted (hsp & mesh are misaligned)

MEMES2 - copied over the new features (esp for 2 bad coils) from MEMES3
    >> doesn't work, mesh and grid have the wrong unit (appears tiny when plotted alongside hsp and sensors) & are misaligned with the hsp and sensors

MEMES3 
    >> doesn't work, as it requires MRI database to be organised in a different format (mesh within each subject folder, etc)

- Run source_v1 using Chinese database & MEMES3
- check coreg plots
- run stats_ROI
